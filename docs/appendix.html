---

## Home/About (index.qmd)

**Purpose (1–2 sentences):**
Introduce [Name] and provide a concise narrative of MBA focus areas, professional direction, and what the reader can expect across the portfolio.

## Outline

## Overview

## What I’m Focusing On

## Highlights

## How to Use This Site

**Sample text (120–200 words):**
Welcome—this site is the professional portfolio of [Name], an MBA candidate at [University] based in [Location]. It is designed to help recruiters, hiring managers, and collaborators quickly understand my areas of interest, the kinds of problems I enjoy solving, and the work products I can deliver.

Across the pages, you will find a structured summary of my background, a curated set of projects and case studies, and a practical inventory of skills and credentials. I’ve organized content to mirror how business decisions are made in practice: clarity on the objective, the analytical approach, the outcome, and the lessons learned. If you are looking for a fast overview, start with the Highlights section and then explore Projects/Case Studies for deeper examples. For role alignment, the Resume/CV page provides a scannable, interview-ready view of experience and capabilities.

---

## Resume/CV (resume.qmd)

**Purpose (1–2 sentences):**
Provide a recruiter-friendly, scannable resume view with clearly labeled experience, education, and impact statements suitable for quick evaluation.

## Outline

## Summary

## Education

## Experience

## Selected Impact

## Additional Information

**Sample text (120–200 words):**
This page presents my resume in a format optimized for rapid review and easy printing. My goal is to make it straightforward to understand the scope of my experience, the types of roles I have held, and the business outcomes I prioritize. Where possible, I use clear action-and-result framing to highlight contributions without unnecessary jargon.

As an MBA candidate at [University], I am developing a toolkit that bridges structured problem solving, stakeholder management, and data-informed decision-making. You will see my experience organized by role, with concise bullets that emphasize ownership, collaboration, and measurable deliverables (expressed generally here as placeholders). If you would prefer a downloadable version, this page can link to a PDF copy of the same content for consistent formatting across devices.

For interviews, I recommend using this page alongside Projects/Case Studies to connect responsibilities to real work outputs and decision narratives.

---

## Projects/Case Studies (projects.qmd)

**Purpose (1–2 sentences):**
Showcase 3–6 curated projects in a case-study format that demonstrates business problem framing, analysis, execution, and results.

## Outline

## Project Portfolio

## Case Study Template

## Project 1

## Project 2

## Project 3

## Reflections and Key Takeaways

**Sample text (120–200 words):**
This section highlights selected projects and case studies that represent how I approach ambiguous business problems. Each entry follows a consistent structure to make comparison easy: context, objective, approach, deliverables, and outcomes. I focus on demonstrating transferable skills—strategy, analysis, communication, and execution—rather than listing tools without business relevance.

Projects may include course-based cases from [University], applied consulting-style engagements, or independent analyses. To avoid overstating outcomes, all metrics and organizational details are represented as placeholders; however, the narrative shows how I translate a question into a decision-ready recommendation. In each case study, I also include a brief “What I’d do next” section that outlines follow-on analyses or implementation steps, reflecting a practical operator mindset.

If you are reviewing me for a specific role, start with the case study that most closely matches your domain and then scan the Reflections section for patterns in how I work.

---

## Skills &amp; Certifications (skills.qmd)

**Purpose (1–2 sentences):**
Provide a categorized, role-relevant inventory of skills, tools, and credentials with proof points and links where appropriate.

## Outline

## Skills Snapshot

## Business and Strategy

## Analytics and Tools

## Communication and Stakeholder Management

## Certifications and Coursework

**Sample text (120–200 words):**
This page consolidates the capabilities I use most often and the credentials that support them. I organize skills by how they show up in real work—strategy and business fundamentals, analytical execution, and communication—so the list is more meaningful than a generic keyword inventory. Where appropriate, I include “evidence cues” such as the types of deliverables I have produced (for example: briefings, models, dashboards, or operating plans), represented here without specific proprietary details.

As an MBA candidate at [University], I prioritize skills that enable better decisions: rigorous structuring of problems, clear assumptions, and stakeholder-friendly storytelling. Certifications and coursework appear as a separate section so you can quickly verify formal training and understand what has been studied recently. Any external profiles or verification links should be added using placeholders such as [LinkedIn].

For hiring teams, this page is intended to complement Projects/Case Studies by showing breadth, while the case studies show depth.

---

## Leadership &amp; Community (leadership.qmd)

**Purpose (1–2 sentences):**
Demonstrate leadership style and values through roles, initiatives, and community engagement, emphasizing collaboration and impact orientation.

## Outline

## Leadership Philosophy

## Leadership Roles

## Community Involvement

## Mentorship and Collaboration

## Lessons Learned

**Sample text (120–200 words):**
Leadership is a consistent thread across my academic and professional work, and this page summarizes how I contribute to teams and communities. My approach emphasizes clarity of purpose, thoughtful prioritization, and respectful execution—especially when working across different perspectives and incentives. I aim to create environments where expectations are explicit, decisions are documented, and progress is visible.

Here you will find a selection of leadership roles and community commitments represented at a high level. Each entry can include the scope of responsibility, the stakeholders involved, and the kinds of outcomes pursued, using placeholders rather than specific claims. I also include mentorship and collaboration as a dedicated section to highlight how I support others—through onboarding, feedback, and creating reusable resources.

Finally, the Lessons Learned section captures patterns I’ve observed about influence without authority, running effective meetings, and communicating trade-offs. If you are assessing culture fit, this page provides a more personal view of how I show up beyond formal job descriptions.

---

## Contact (contact.qmd)

**Purpose (1–2 sentences):**
Make it easy to reach [Name] and provide clear options for professional connection and follow-up.

## Outline

## Get in Touch

## Preferred Topics

## Availability Notes

## Links

**Sample text (120–200 words):**
I welcome professional conversations related to internships, full-time roles, project collaborations, and alumni connections. The most reliable way to contact me is by email at [Email]. You may also connect with me on [LinkedIn], where I periodically share updates and maintain a current professional profile.

To help us use time efficiently, it is helpful if your message includes the context for reaching out (role, team, or initiative), the timeline you are working with, and what you would like as a next step (for example: an introductory call, a resume review, or a discussion of a specific case study on this site). If you reference a particular project, please mention the case-study title so I can quickly locate the relevant materials.

I am based in [Location] and can coordinate across time zones when needed. Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to connecting.

# Quarto-Specific Design Recommendations (3–5)

1. **Use a professional theme + typographic polish:** Start with a clean Quarto HTML theme (e.g., a Bootstrap-based theme) and customize `theme:` plus `css:` for spacing, readable line-length, and consistent heading hierarchy across pages.
2. **Navbar tools for quick access:** Add a right-aligned navbar area with icons/links for [LinkedIn] and an email link to [Email]; include a prominent “Download PDF” button on the Resume/CV page.
3. **Listings for Projects/Case Studies:** Implement a Quarto `listing` to render projects as cards with filters/tags (e.g., Strategy, Finance, Ops) and sorting (e.g., newest/featured), improving scanning and discoverability.
4. **Callouts for highlights and recruiter cues:** Use Quarto callouts (e.g., “Key takeaway,” “Impact,” “Tools used”) in each case study to standardize how outcomes and methods are presented.
5. **Tabsets for Skills organization:** Use tabsets on Skills &amp; Certifications to separate “Business,” “Analytics,” and “Communication,” keeping the page concise while still complete.

# LLM-Use Disclosure (Appendix-ready)

Portions of this website’s draft structure and sample language were generated with the assistance of a large language model (LLM) to accelerate outlining and editing. All final content, selection of materials, and representations of experience are intended to be reviewed and validated by [Name] to ensure accuracy, appropriate confidentiality, and alignment with professional standards.</code></pre>
