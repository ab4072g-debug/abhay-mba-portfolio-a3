It is designed to help recruiters, hiring managers, and collaborators quickly understand my areas of interest, the kinds of problems I enjoy solving, and the work products I can deliver.\n\nAcross the pages, you will find a structured summary of my background, a curated set of projects and case studies, and a practical inventory of skills and credentials. I’ve organized content to mirror how business decisions are made in practice: clarity on the objective, the analytical approach, the outcome, and the lessons learned. If you are looking for a fast overview, start with the Highlights section and then explore Projects/Case Studies for deeper examples. For role alignment, the Resume/CV page provides a scannable, interview-ready view of experience and capabilities.\n\n---\n\n## Resume/CV (resume.qmd)\n\n**Purpose (1–2 sentences):**\nProvide a recruiter-friendly, scannable resume view with clearly labeled experience, education, and impact statements suitable for quick evaluation.\n\n## Outline\n\n## Summary\n\n## Education\n\n## Experience\n\n## Selected Impact\n\n## Additional Information\n\n**Sample text (120–200 words):**\nThis page presents my resume in a format optimized for rapid review and easy printing. My goal is to make it straightforward to understand the scope of my experience, the types of roles I have held, and the business outcomes I prioritize. Where possible, I use clear action-and-result framing to highlight contributions without unnecessary jargon.\n\nAs an MBA candidate at [University], I am developing a toolkit that bridges structured problem solving, stakeholder management, and data-informed decision-making. You will see my experience organized by role, with concise bullets that emphasize ownership, collaboration, and measurable deliverables (expressed generally here as placeholders). If you would prefer a downloadable version, this page can link to a PDF copy of the same content for consistent formatting across devices.\n\nFor interviews, I recommend using this page alongside Projects/Case Studies to connect responsibilities to real work outputs and decision narratives.\n\n---\n\n## Projects/Case Studies (projects.qmd)\n\n**Purpose (1–2 sentences):**\nShowcase 3–6 curated projects in a case-study format that demonstrates business problem framing, analysis, execution, and results.\n\n## Outline\n\n## Project Portfolio\n\n## Case Study Template\n\n## Project 1\n\n## Project 2\n\n## Project 3\n\n## Reflections and Key Takeaways\n\n**Sample text (120–200 words):**\nThis section highlights selected projects and case studies that represent how I approach ambiguous business problems. Each entry follows a consistent structure to make comparison easy: context, objective, approach, deliverables, and outcomes. I focus on demonstrating transferable skills—strategy, analysis, communication, and execution—rather than listing tools without business relevance.\n\nProjects may include course-based cases from [University], applied consulting-style engagements, or independent analyses. To avoid overstating outcomes, all metrics and organizational details are represented as placeholders; however, the narrative shows how I translate a question into a decision-ready recommendation. In each case study, I also include a brief “What I’d do next” section that outlines follow-on analyses or implementation steps, reflecting a practical operator mindset.\n\nIf you are reviewing me for a specific role, start with the case study that most closely matches your domain and then scan the Reflections section for patterns in how I work.\n\n---\n\n## Skills & Certifications (skills.qmd)\n\n**Purpose (1–2 sentences):**\nProvide a categorized, role-relevant inventory of skills, tools, and credentials with proof points and links where appropriate.\n\n## Outline\n\n## Skills Snapshot\n\n## Business and Strategy\n\n## Analytics and Tools\n\n## Communication and Stakeholder Management\n\n## Certifications and Coursework\n\n**Sample text (120–200 words):**\nThis page consolidates the capabilities I use most often and the credentials that support them. I organize skills by how they show up in real work—strategy and business fundamentals, analytical execution, and communication—so the list is more meaningful than a generic keyword inventory. Where appropriate, I include “evidence cues” such as the types of deliverables I have produced (for example: briefings, models, dashboards, or operating plans), represented here without specific proprietary details.\n\nAs an MBA candidate at [University], I prioritize skills that enable better decisions: rigorous structuring of problems, clear assumptions, and stakeholder-friendly storytelling. Certifications and coursework appear as a separate section so you can quickly verify formal training and understand what has been studied recently. Any external profiles or verification links should be added using placeholders such as [LinkedIn].\n\nFor hiring teams, this page is intended to complement Projects/Case Studies by showing breadth, while the case studies show depth.\n\n---\n\n## Leadership & Community (leadership.qmd)\n\n**Purpose (1–2 sentences):**\nDemonstrate leadership style and values through roles, initiatives, and community engagement, emphasizing collaboration and impact orientation.\n\n## Outline\n\n## Leadership Philosophy\n\n## Leadership Roles\n\n## Community Involvement\n\n## Mentorship and Collaboration\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n**Sample text (120–200 words):**\nLeadership is a consistent thread across my academic and professional work, and this page summarizes how I contribute to teams and communities. My approach emphasizes clarity of purpose, thoughtful prioritization, and respectful execution—especially when working across different perspectives and incentives. I aim to create environments where expectations are explicit, decisions are documented, and progress is visible.\n\nHere you will find a selection of leadership roles and community commitments represented at a high level. Each entry can include the scope of responsibility, the stakeholders involved, and the kinds of outcomes pursued, using placeholders rather than specific claims. I also include mentorship and collaboration as a dedicated section to highlight how I support others—through onboarding, feedback, and creating reusable resources.\n\nFinally, the Lessons Learned section captures patterns I’ve observed about influence without authority, running effective meetings, and communicating trade-offs. If you are assessing culture fit, this page provides a more personal view of how I show up beyond formal job descriptions.\n\n---\n\n## Contact (contact.qmd)\n\n**Purpose (1–2 sentences):**\nMake it easy to reach [Name] and provide clear options for professional connection and follow-up.\n\n## Outline\n\n## Get in Touch\n\n## Preferred Topics\n\n## Availability Notes\n\n## Links\n\n**Sample text (120–200 words):**\nI welcome professional conversations related to internships, full-time roles, project collaborations, and alumni connections. The most reliable way to contact me is by email at [Email]. You may also connect with me on [LinkedIn], where I periodically share updates and maintain a current professional profile.\n\nTo help us use time efficiently, it is helpful if your message includes the context for reaching out (role, team, or initiative), the timeline you are working with, and what you would like as a next step (for example: an introductory call, a resume review, or a discussion of a specific case study on this site). If you reference a particular project, please mention the case-study title so I can quickly locate the relevant materials.\n\nI am based in [Location] and can coordinate across time zones when needed. Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to connecting.\n\n---\n\n# Quarto-Specific Design Recommendations (3–5)\n\n1. **Use a professional theme + typographic polish:** Start with a clean Quarto HTML theme (e.g., a Bootstrap-based theme) and customize `theme:` plus `css:` for spacing, readable line-length, and consistent heading hierarchy across pages.\n2. **Navbar tools for quick access:** Add a right-aligned navbar area with icons/links for [LinkedIn] and an email link to [Email]; include a prominent “Download PDF” button on the Resume/CV page.\n3. **Listings for Projects/Case Studies:** Implement a Quarto `listing` to render projects as cards with filters/tags (e.g., Strategy, Finance, Ops) and sorting (e.g., newest/featured), improving scanning and discoverability.\n4. **Callouts for highlights and recruiter cues:** Use Quarto callouts (e.g., “Key takeaway,” “Impact,” “Tools used”) in each case study to standardize how outcomes and methods are presented.\n5. **Tabsets for Skills organization:** Use tabsets on Skills & Certifications to separate “Business,” “Analytics,” and “Communication,” keeping the page concise while still complete.\n\n---\n\n# LLM-Use Disclosure (Appendix-ready)\n\nPortions of this website’s draft structure and sample language were generated with the assistance of a large language model (LLM) to accelerate outlining and editing. All final content, selection of materials, and representations of experience are intended to be reviewed and validated by [Name] to ensure accuracy, appropriate confidentiality, and alignment with professional standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall site map with six pages (Home/About, Resume/CV, Projects/Case Studies, Skills & Certifications, Leadership & Community, Contact).\nThe suggested file structure and navigation labels (index.qmd, resume.qmd, projects.qmd, skills.qmd, leadership.qmd, contact.qmd).\nThe idea of using Quarto design features such as navbar tools, listings for projects, callouts for highlights, and tabsets for skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nI did not use the sample text paragraphs directly; instead, I rewrote all page content to reflect my actual education, experience, skills, and interests.\nI adjusted the headings and section descriptions to better match my personal narrative and the specific way I want recruiters and collaborators to understand my profile.\nI removed any generic claims and replaced them with concrete, factual details that I can support with my resume and real projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll dates, roles, organizations, and accomplishments on the final website are based on my real background and have been double-checked against my resume and personal records.\nI avoided including any confidential or proprietary information from employers or clients and kept descriptions at an appropriate level of abstraction.\nI used the LLM strictly as a brainstorming and drafting tool; the final wording, structure, and emphasis are mine and were reviewed to align with academic integrity and professional standards."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As I expanded my portfolio from a single-page website to a multi-page site, I changed how I used a large language model (LLM). In Assignment 1, the LLM was most helpful for creating an initial outline and sample language. In Assignment 3, the biggest value was in planning and structure. I used the LLM to brainstorm a complete site map with multiple pages, propose a consistent layout for each page, and suggest Quarto features that can improve readability. This reduced the time needed to move from an empty project to a clear multi-page plan.\nHowever, generic AI writing can feel like a template and may not represent a real person accurately. To keep the site authentic, I treated the LLM output as a starting point, not final content. I rewrote the pages in my own words based on my resume and my personal experience. I also checked that every claim in the portfolio is something I can explain and support if asked in an interview. When describing work, I avoided confidential or proprietary details and focused on transferable skills such as communication, customer experience, structured thinking, and reliable execution.\nAs the site grew, usability became more important. I tested navigation and layout on different screen sizes to ensure the site remains readable on a laptop, tablet, or phone. I avoided interaction patterns that might hide content, and I organized information into clear sections so a reviewer can scan quickly. I also added a PDF resume link so recruiters can open the resume in a consistent format.\nOverall, adding pages improved the portfolio by separating content into focused sections and allowing deeper detail without overcrowding one page. The LLM helped me plan efficiently, and my reviewing and editing ensured the final site is professional, accurate, and in my own voice.\n\n\n\nQuarto documentation (website and markdown features)\nChatGPT (LLM) for planning and draft assistance\nAPA Style resources (citation guidance, when needed)"
