# Reflection (Assignment 3): Evolving use of LLMs (300 to 500 words)

As I expanded my portfolio from a single-page website to a multi-page site, I changed how I used a large language model (LLM). In Assignment 1, the LLM was most helpful for creating an initial outline and sample language. In Assignment 3, the biggest value was in planning and structure. I used the LLM to brainstorm a complete site map with multiple pages, propose a consistent layout for each page, and suggest Quarto features that can improve readability. This reduced the time needed to move from an empty project to a clear multi-page plan.

However, generic AI writing can feel like a template and may not represent a real person accurately. To keep the site authentic, I treated the LLM output as a starting point, not final content. I rewrote the pages in my own words based on my resume and my personal experience. I also checked that every claim in the portfolio is something I can explain and support if asked in an interview. When describing work, I avoided confidential or proprietary details and focused on transferable skills such as communication, customer experience, structured thinking, and reliable execution.

As the site grew, usability became more important. I tested navigation and layout on different screen sizes to ensure the site remains readable on a laptop, tablet, or phone. I avoided interaction patterns that might hide content, and I organized information into clear sections so a reviewer can scan quickly. I also added a PDF resume link so recruiters can open the resume in a consistent format.

Overall, adding pages improved the portfolio by separating content into focused sections and allowing deeper detail without overcrowding one page. The LLM helped me plan efficiently, and my reviewing and editing ensured the final site is professional, accurate, and in my own voice.
